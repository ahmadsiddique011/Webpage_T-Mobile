				<p>On September 15, 2015, T-Mobile USA disclosed that it had experienced a data breach that impacted over 15 million current and potential customers. The breach was initially discovered
					 in July 2015, and an investigation was launched immediately. T-Mobile later determined that the breach was caused by hackers who had gained access to its servers through a third-party
					 sss vendor. The hackers were able to steal sensitive customer information, including names, addresses, birthdates, Social Security numbers, and other personal identification data.</p>

				<p>The 2015 T-Mobile USA data breach was caused by hackers who gained unauthorized access to T-Mobile's servers through a third-party vendor. This third-party vendor was a company that provided
					 services to T-Mobile, and the hackers exploited vulnerabilities in the vendor's systems to gain access to T-Mobile's network. Once inside the network, the attackers were able to steal sensitive
					  customer information, including names, addresses, birthdates, Social Security numbers, and other personal identification data. The root cause of the breach was a failure of T-Mobile to adequately
					   assess the security posture of its third-party vendors and ensure that they were implementing sufficient security measures. This oversight allowed the attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the
						vendor's systems to gain access to T-Mobile's network.</p>
